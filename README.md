# boarding-ENAM-school-management-
National School of Agriculture Meknes (Morocco) contains three boarding schools, Each boarding school has four floors, And each floor has several rooms. To facilitate the management of the boarding school and to know the information of the students, I developed a web application "INTERNAM" The name ‘INTERNAM’ is an abbreviation of INTERNAT-ENAM. INTERNAM ask to enter the information of the boarding school of each student (boarding number, floor number and room number…) Students in the database can be searched, added, modified and deleted Finally, the database can be printed and stored.
